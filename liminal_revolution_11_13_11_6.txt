between Cody Kennedy and Ania Urbanska (facebook)

and i plan on finishing college here 
idk im back to being an alien on my home planet i guess
but its ok 
im truly alone out here but thats what i wanted
for the time being


well at least you have internet friends
i'm with you on the internet

haah i have friends here

yes

i mean alone with my mind

the constant party
it's always good to be alone with your mind
i can't write papers and talk
or be in a library
an empty library maybe

i like libraries
my school has a very good library
im not even technically a current student but ill go there and use their computers / books anyway
hah

oh nice
how are you not a student?

im returning next semester

ah
what school?
also that's cool do you audit

columbus college of art & design

yeah that's awesome that you are taking a sem off
considering doing that so that i can get better classes
maybe i could travel

well i transferred schools to one in colorado
but that one sucked

i'm caught between completing a current major and transferring

i basically dropped out
havent been in school since march

i really want to go to otis or art center
but i have all my friends here

but i can finish here within a year

tough decision

transferring sucks

calarts would be nice

dont do it stick thru it
where do you go now

usc
ya i should
but maybe a different major
the critical studies focus in cinema is amazing
but so is the art school
there's also a new comedy focus which i'd love to be a part of
comedy is intensely #goodvibes

yes'

i mean i don't EVER want to leave this school
i mean jesus christ i love everything that happens here
fucking werner herzog and jon rafman in a single day
like... and not only that but rafman and herzog have EERILY similar styles of filmmaking
and someday maybe soon someone will argue that jon rafman is the postmodern herzog
relishing in the technologically transcendent where herzog loves the natural
