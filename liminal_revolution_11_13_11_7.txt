dude i'm starting the fucking liminal revolution
and it's going to be CHOICE

wats liminal revolution mean
whts choice

 choice being that place
where you truly think your thoughts will matter to someone
ie curation
ie the choices made in every day life
when you talk to a person you can either choose things based on their vibes
and make it a choice convo
or make it a pointless convo
and not choose what you say
this is life eddy
eddy this is the future
the future is relevant upon planes of immanence

how is this a revolution if it already happens

choice is all that matters
revolutions will be live
revolutions will be ongoing
revolutions will be interactive
and revolutions will be about synchronicity all over the planet
i will do all i can to provide the world with relevancy

whats a revolution though

TALKING LIKE A JERK
BUT YOU ARE AN ACTUAL JERK
