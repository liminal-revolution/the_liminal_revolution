so cool that mtv has animation now
and one of the shows is called good vibes
and is about california which psh fuckin all about it
lived here for 3 years

haha i havent seen that

oh it's so cheesy/bad

i dont have cable and dont like to know about shows i can't watch lol

lots of penis humor
aw
too bad
but beavis and butthead is pretty good
the new ones
they are almost exactly like the old ones
like i actually fantasized about a beavis and butthead in current day
many years ago
and wanted them to watch videos of like soulja boy

oh dude i've seen the new beavis and butthead 
it's amazing

yesss
right?

so hilarious

luv it

the first episode was really
perfect

i KNOW
they tell a bum to bite them so they become undead
that was fucking mindblowing
and then they get viruses
which is arguably the source of the myth
fuck that was actually a genius episode
hey you don't mind if i take this conversation and use it for an art proj
it's gonna be sick
it's called the liminal revolution and it will be hosted on github not unlike ryder's gitpoetry
but much better and more future

but much better and more future
lol

i mean the two are apples and oranges so i don't mean to compare the two
like...
i actually sent him a message on github pointing out the synchronous quality of it
maybe i'll post some gitpoetry and maybe he'll post a convo

what is your art proj

i'm gonna start it tonight
and you will be able to see it in all its glory
including this convo
vry vry soon

the whole convo?

ya why not

doubt anything in this conversation might come in handy later lol
but i guess BeTteR sAfE thAN S0Ryy

R u SuRe??/?/?

this might be...
MIGHT
be a book
what if this was in a book
and reading it right now was a post-grad at harvard
thinking 'omg how the fuck did they know'
'how could they have known that my journey would lead me to this point almost 20 years prior'
and then he annotates it with his orange sharpie

i don't think that would happen but what do I know

and runs to his professor
and shouts to all the students THIS WAS A SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY
that guy better fucking email me
vivagoodvibes@gmail.com
I'm waiting.
anyway imma save this and GO I HAVE SO MUCH SHIT TO DO
