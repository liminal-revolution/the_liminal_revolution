hey so i'm sorry I walked out early on your lecture at roski, I had to get to work but yeah that was crazy seeing you smash up your file! tweeted about it on my new twitter/social media project viva good vibes

also something you said about the line between critique and celebration collapsing over the internet really resonated with me. Viva Good Vibes is kind of akin to that idea, I'm devoted to positivity but I also want everyone to realize that positive vibes are still pretty hard to come by, that the pursuit of them is more important than their actual existence, that transcendence needs to come from activity and not idealist visions of 'positivity' we associate with quotes from people like Siddhartha or Confucius.

I've been meaning to craft a few shout out tweets to you not unlike the ones I did for jstchillin and mitch trale:

I would also like to just say that after you lectured, I went to see Herzog's new film "Into the Abyss" and realized the intense similarity between your styles of filmmaking, even though Codes of Honor is, in my opinion, far more interesting than Abyss. I wanted to ask Herzog a question during the Q&A about how he feels about increased instances of people that can craft narratives around youtube videos rather than just releasing full length features all the time, and how that culture has affected his filmmaking. of course at the cinema school, Herzog got the impression he was surrounded by a bunch of fucking idiots and devoted most of his talking to 'read books or you'll never be a great filmmaker' true but unnecessary to say.

I hope this isn't 'too much to process' but I am a big fan of yours and think that we share a lot of similar ideas! it's interesting to me that our journeys have become somewhat intertwined and I don't think it's a coincidence that my timeline banner picture, taken by someone at the Read/Write show, centered my little head. I actually put that up as the timeline picture because it was just some pic I was tagged in, but I liked how it looked so I kept it.

well, good lookin' out jon and I hope that your film with seecoy turns out well, which I'm sure it will. Also did your harakiri kool aid man draw any inspiration from mishima's patriotism?

also how would you feel about remaking Luther Price's "Sodom" (an experimental 8mm film about absolute homosexual excess, homophobia to the soundtrack of gregorian chants, images of men sucking their own dicks) in second life?
I mean you're a busy guy, obviously it's my idea and I should follow through but I could use some pointers. Would LOVE to follow through and actually make it.
