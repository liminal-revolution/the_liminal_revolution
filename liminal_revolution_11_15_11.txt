Cody Kennedy i love how he accuses art as being from the mind of someone with serious mental disorders. adolf wölfli spent his whole life in an institution and i'm reading about the studies that were done on his enormous body of work and how they affected both art study and psychoanalysis. richard dadd murdered his father with a knife after he thought he was the devil, was also institutionalized. he painted stuff like this, paranoid schizophrenic but also of the same mentality of pre-raphaelites http://www.artexpertswebsite.com/pages/artists/artists_a-k/dadd/Dadd_TitaniaSleeping.jpg

Will Neibergall also its silly to talk about any relationship between creative expression and "mental disorders" seeing as most things considered mental impairments are, to some degree, socially founded based on deviation from the norm as far as brain chemistry goes, and the art gallery or 'art location' is said to be an ideologically neutral environment

Cody Kennedy you're gonna have to expand on that last one, why is it silly to think about disorders and art?
23 minutes ago · Like

Will Neibergall well some mental disorders are legitimate impairments but, for example, words like "retarded" and medical conditions like attention deficit disorder, depression, asperger's syndrome, etc have a strictly social context
21 minutes ago · Like
Cody Kennedy ‎.... that's not true will. MDD is a disorder

Ian Clark in my opinion the relationship between mental disorders and art is largely romanticized by people who want to enjoy the tortured artist trope.

Will Neibergall ‎"characterized by an all-encompassing low mood accompanied by low self-esteem, and by loss of interest or pleasure in normally enjoyable activities" all subjective phenomena
20 minutes ago · Like
Cody Kennedy ok what you're discussing is the relationship between social sciences and chemical sciences. the two are inseparable, almost any subjective phenomenon in your brain can be traced back to a chemical process.
18 minutes ago · Like

Will Neibergall i guess what im getting at is that mental irregularities are highly personal, dependent on individual emotional stimuli, etc, theres no way to standardize them to the point where you can say "Oh yeah this artists creative output can be judged differently because they are clearly affected by [x] disorder"
18 minutes ago · Like

Will Neibergall yeah cody but the individual subjective factors that are produced by your brain chemistry are still applied in a society in which they are unique. im saying that the standardization of different behaviors that are clearly unique to different people is silly
17 minutes ago · Like

Will Neibergall and the fact that its not black and white, cut and dry makes it even sillier when applied to creative expression/art
16 minutes ago · Like
Cody Kennedy i'm not saying that standardization should be a norm but you're suggesting everyone write off psychoanalysis as a way to contextualize
16 minutes ago · Like
Cody Kennedy which i just disagree with
16 minutes ago · Like
Cody Kennedy i don't even think psychoanalysis is even that great of a science, deleuze called it fascism
15 minutes ago · Like
Will Neibergall oh no psychoanalysis is relevant but its still somewhat repugnant for andy rooney to say that an artist (good or not) is mentally messed up as criticism
14 minutes ago · Like
Cody Kennedy but i mean for instance morganthaler's Ein Geisteskranker als Künstler is crucial in understanding adolf wolfli as an art historical text even if his writings were heavily influenced by freud, who was of course the pioneer of psychoanalysis
13 minutes ago · Like
Will Neibergall theres a difference between commenting on a piece by referring to the artists mental condition and criticizing a piece based on ur perception of the artists mental irregularity and its bearing on the quality of the expression

Cody Kennedy well that's the problem with people like andy rooney (or plenty of fucking politicians) they make an accusation or a statement, the statement's implications speak for themselves and then... that's it
