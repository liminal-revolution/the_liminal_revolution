between Cody Kennedy and Liz PartyRock (Facebook)

i told my friend your name was partyrock and told the rave story
and referred to u as partyrock
ie 'so me and partyrock were just RAVING HXC'
and he was CRACKING. UP
'that's some shit you need to write a book about, that's some brett easton ellis shit'
i don't know if you read brett easton ellis BUT YOU ARE SUCH A BRETT EASTON ELLIS CHARACTER
in the informers, a book about la there's a character that goes to usc and wears a usc hoodie
omg actually

LMAO
omg - im actually known as partyrock


NOT TO INSINUATE PARTYROCK!!
ur more like a tragic character, a character who just wants tru romance but looks in all the wrong places!


 fuck


learn from your mistakes partyrock
u are your own pilot
like morpheus says: i can only show you the door, only you can open it ! #goodvibes


i feel like you're a litte guru or something
like my conscious


it would be my honor to be your jiminy cricket


=)))) 


pinocchio is my favorite disney movie actually
i've seen plenty, got the whole collection on vhs
but when you look for a true masterpiece, pinocchio is perfect


i feel like im gunna break another heart or something


dude i was actually hoping this would come up


it is  it;s about growing up


don't worry partyrock, my  compass is all haywire
i fall in love every day


lol thats so beautiful though!


i'm married to the global unconscious and i can't cheat on her

 ****
sadface



i don't know who im in love with


you are young fair partyrock
its okay to fall in and out of love
it is something you must learn to do


its crazy because i have like these crazy expectations of love
like my parents got married at 17 and theyve been together 26 years
Today


you must hold yourself to the wax and wain of the spirits, the color of the wind, the wishes on the stars


they were like first loves and crap


oh my gosh dont ever dothat


same thing with my grandparents


you are you they are them
how could they know what it is to fall in love for half an hour over the internet
or while rolling
this is the generation of the connected, the first internet natives, we know things our parents dont


yea


we feel things they will never feel


i like that
we're so different


how could they have any idea what it meant to be 'partyrockxd' on aim when u were just a lil 10 yr old


but like im such a hopeless romantic


me too


like old school


like crashing waves flowing hair??
like lets run away to paris?


always


thats so sweet


or like lets just make our own world
like where no1 else matters but you and i and when everything else is falling down, we still have each other
i don't think anyone will ever experience what i define as love the way i do
but like there's no better feeling
nothing but you two matter and you can just be


i think as much as you could communicate through an instant message is a place everyone wants to be
for a time the internet was my 'everythings crashing down'
i still have the internet you know
and even that can go away
why do you think i'm feeling such #goodvibes
everything in my life was taken from me and i could still start a conversation with a guy smoking a cigarette outside of a building





and he could say 'i work appeals in welfare' and i could still learn something


dude yea
its awesome


people are less fortunate than me and my stupid troubles


like i learned that living abroad



than me and my internet addiction


YES
like i literally was left with nothing

literally nothing
and thats when i realized
IM ALIV
EE


that's the rave


SUPRISE
YOU ARE ALIVE


the global rave


being alive?


'everything you have is gone, but you are still alive'


yea


'you are still alive, even if it wont be okay in the morning'
thats what i learned at hard and i realized


yea


that life is a rave
life is a constant healing process


o shit

yea
its not death
people say you begin to die the moment you are born
but no


life is the migraines you get from seratonin loss and life is every possibility


you begin to live and continue to live


liz, we are the post-emo generation
we are the generation of fuck it lets dance


YES
FUCKING LOVE IT
YES
OMG
DUDE YES
WHETHER WE'RE MESSED UP
R NOT
OR*
WE JUST DANCE

AND THERES NO BETTER FEELING
WHEN RUSKO'S HOLD ON CAME ON
I WAS DEAD
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO FAINT


http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6_Oltb852o


AND HONESTLY
IDANCED THE HARDEST TO THAT SONG


i missed zomby for a reason
i was with zomby in spirit



you didn't miss anything


i didn't need to hear fuck mixing lets dance
i lived it



EXACTLY
i want to just start a rave in the middle of figueroa
just start dancing
see how many ppl will join


occupy fig
lets do it


and then see how many djs would show u[


http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQcYspfvLqY


OMG
YES


okay if you have time watch that entire youtube video


what is it
my comp is really slow


let it load
and tell me why i'm fucking crying
probably the most intense emotions


you're crying right now?


i have ever felt
yeah


from the video?


but i need it
i need a good cry
i'm in a public library and i'm crying


serotonin level - depleted
i cried in ballet class on tuesday


crying from happiness dude


=)))


i feel the rhythms of the night
dude beau travail is my life
i think it's my favorite movie now
i only have a few but they all deal with people losing everything and trying to start over
and now i know why
talking to partyrock on a wednesday night



it happens


it all comes crashing down with beautiful ecstatic harmony


you have everything you need to succeed at any given point
in time
its a beautiful thing


i had that exact thought
coming down some stairs
and you know what
the fact that u feel it and i feel it simultaneously is just part of the rhythm of the night
it's got nothing to do with our problems or our head cases or what we tell our shrinks
at any given moment you feel what i feel


isnt that sick


at any given moment a person can transmit a love affair
transmit a beautiful harmonious cataclysm without even knowing it


love is the freest thing to give

you know what i think?


what?


i think we were all psychic at one point
and we were all one


there are no psychics liz


like you know how we feel and sense


there are no mediums


but theres emotion
how do you explain emotion


there are only people and people can feel everything
everything you can't touch taste or feel
with your skin
you can feel it in your skin


but inside


through your skin
inside your bones


but we feel things so deep
you know
like just by being


just being present
you are already connected


exactly


i agree


you know whats also crazy?
how like even though im typing letters
and words
online
you still understand what i feel too


we are just pieces of the rhizome
we are branches on the tree





theres no where you can go where i can't feel a piece of you inside me, through me


we make up the human race


we aren't hippies we're better than that
we know better
we have better philosophy
we're faster, stronger, more people can agree with it at once



hippies = peace
use = connection

we just understand


our generation = the past present and future and the generation of the now is always the best generation
the hippies WERE the best generation
in san francisco enough people realized what we're realizing now
but the best thing about it, the revolution will not be televised
the revolution is live



it's felt
it's going to move from san fran
all the way around the world


the revolution is live, instantly transferable, felt by more people every day


it's a beautiful world


its already moved young partyrock
its moving all the time
