duder!
do you have a minute?

Thursday 
oh cody ive been thinking

ThursdayCody Kennedy
maybe less than a minute

Thursday 
is there any fundamental difference between homosexuality and pedophilia

ThursdayCody Kennedy
???????

Thursday 
like if you think about it theyre both techinically diseases
and the ppl afflicted with them both think that what theyre doing is beneficial to society
and the culture is just prejudiced against them
both of them were historically mainstream in a lot of cultures

ThursdayCody Kennedy
hm

Thursday 
so objectively theyre very similar

ThursdayCody Kennedy
i dunno ***
i just watched some of larry price's films
and one of them was literally a gay orgy
basically sodomy with gregorian chants
and then people sucking their own dicks
it was pretty fucking enlightening to be honest

Thursday 
in what way

ThursdayCody Kennedy
the comparisons made between the rites of mass and the rites of fucking are somewhat similar
fucking someone in the ass has just as much ritual as a catholic rite
so i don't think pedophelia and homosexuality are the same thing but your thoughts are duly noted
certainly a controversial ***ism


Thursday 
no i mean if you think about it
removed from every social moray

ThursdayCody Kennedy
i thought about it max and no the two are not very similar
certainly the two have parallels but one is absolutely unacceptable in my mind
well i mean the line can get fuzzy when the people are mature enough
but at the same time i just don't think the two are the same and it's mostly because i refuse to
i admit that i'm refusing to 'go there'
but yeah definitely can't agree with you on pretense of moral boundaries
but dude read my review of melancholia

Thursday 
hahahaha
where is it!

i want to add to it but it's short and sweet so i'll just let it go

ThursdayCody Kennedy
After a few quick searches online, it has become intensely apparent how much Lars von Trier is influenced by Kurt Schwitters and his Merzbau, the architectural writings of Elizabeth Burns Gamard, the psychoanalytic writings of Julia Kristeva and World of Warcraft. Yes, LVT plays World of Warcraft, I guarantee it.

ThursdayCody Kennedy
but there were some new developments ^

Thursday 
oh god i love schwitters

ThursdayCody Kennedy
right???
i was in a lecture about him THE FUCKING DAY of melancholia

i swear to fucking god
