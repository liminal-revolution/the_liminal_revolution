all the planets are aligning
for an afternoon online that's neverending

{:∏—{
sorry
that was a kitten

it looks cool!

@okkervilriver once replied to me and that was probably the height of my twitter using experience and maybe I've stumbled upon a new smilie or whatever

woah cool
i like your new smiley
you should finish it

I'm jealous of your upcoming concerts

omfg
i can't possibly make them all
that's why i listed as interested
but holy fuck
it's been crazy listening to insane amounts of music
to populate that new lastfm

yeah
why'd you create a new one?

it felt right

it's for my new online identity

ha
yeah
good vibes

http://www.last.fm/user/vivagoodvibes/charts?rangetype=overall&subtype=artists i have 31 artists with 4 plays and up
i think that's a pretty solid start
my recommended radio sounds really nutty

ha
yeah?

yeah it's really refreshing
total hipster victory i don't know any of the artists

haha
nice


it's cool
just started listening to casiotone for the painfully alone
pretty good band
one of my friend's top listened
like 2000 plays
etc

yeah
a friend of mine loves them

i dig it
oh man i'm so excited
i'm about to jailbreak my iphone
and free all my illegally downloaded paid apps
i should really log off though
fyi i might include this convo in an art project
