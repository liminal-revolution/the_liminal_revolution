oh i was just wondering if i like hallucinated facebook comments and thought i was typing something when i was actually typing something else that was super disturbing

October 11Bea Fremderman
hahahaha
what?!

October 11Cody Kennedy
that was pretty interesting i think we're finding a real set of abstractions in 21st century facebook commentary
'comment' - ary
anyway sorry i'm being cryptic whats up

October 11Bea Fremderman
ya cut that out
you're like single uncle at thanksgiving

October 11Cody Kennedy
oh my god that makes so much sense

October 11Bea Fremderman
lol

October 11Cody Kennedy
i actually do wonder if people read what i write and feel embarassed
for me

October 11Bea Fremderman
embarrassed is an intense word

October 11Cody Kennedy
yeah...
i think i try to act like it doesn't actually exist in my mind but i find myself being embarassed a lot

October 11Bea Fremderman
everyones like that
kindof maybe
depends on how frequently you feel that way

October 11Cody Kennedy
yeah definitely, like i showed up late to class today and when i tried to sit down a guy went for his coffee at the exact same time
which was under my seat
and he just yelled 'DUDE' and then looked really pissed off
and i apologized and he didn't say anything back
it's just that kind of shit all the time...

October 11Bea Fremderman
lol
DON'T TAKE IT
people are assholes i feel like i am an asshole

October 11Cody Kennedy
yeah i mean i know it's just assholes but there's a certain chipping away factor

October 11Bea Fremderman
i might be the person saying "dude" and looking pissed off and not saying anything after someone apologizes just cause i can be cranky in the morning but i will immediately feel bad/awkward

October 11Cody Kennedy
yeah i get that too
it's hard to get angry at those people because you know so little about them

October 11Bea Fremderman
fuck 'em

October 11Cody Kennedy
yup
2 tru

October 11Bea Fremderman
some people are just comfortable with their anger
so you gotta just think about it like that
if you're comfortable when you are nice and polite
and feel uncomfortable when you are rude/angry
some people feel the opposite

October 11Cody Kennedy
wow never thought about it like that

October 11Bea Fremderman
some people feel uncomfortable when they are too nice
you are pulling my leg

October 11Cody Kennedy
no!
i actually never thought anyone could be comfortable being angry all the time
i always thought of it as sort of a constant admission of self hatred
but it makes sense that anger could be one of those things people just get addicted to, the adrenaline rush of it
i guess i always look at those thrill seeker people and think 'how could they be so at peace with the world when they do something so grotesque'

October 11Bea Fremderman
i donno anger comes in many forms
i think you are talking about extremes

October 11Cody Kennedy
i tend to do that

October 11Bea Fremderman
i am just talking about being comfortable with being in a bad mood in front of other people and not censoring yourself
they just don't think about it
it's inappropriate
but they just don't think about it
you juss gotta make those people feel like idiots

October 11Cody Kennedy
i have to go right now but great points
thank you!

October 11Bea Fremderman
byeeeeeee
