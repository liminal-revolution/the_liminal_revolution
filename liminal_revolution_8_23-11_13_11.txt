August 29Eugene Kotlyarenko
whoa - weird. how does he have a copy?
haha

August 29Cody Kennedy
I'm not sure!

August 29Eugene Kotlyarenko
i will check with my producer, maybe he gave it to him....

August 29Cody Kennedy
Good question but yeah all I can really do is wait to see if he wants to fit it in
Also no problem
Oh yeah so I read that interview

August 29Eugene Kotlyarenko
feel u, obvi he will dig it when he sees it
cool what did u think?

August 29Cody Kennedy
I lol'd because I totally took Joseph to read/write
And he didn't remember

August 29Eugene Kotlyarenko
ya cool, but maybe he doesnt remember...

August 29Cody Kennedy
Or recognize that it was the same show

August 29Eugene Kotlyarenko
that is interesting tho cuz that would be around the first time he contacted me to get a tick to 0s & 1s
u know, these days, we all live in small werls

August 29Cody Kennedy
Yeah I was in ny that week and I regrettably didn't see yr movie
Ya truf

August 29Eugene Kotlyarenko
even more reason for it to play at usc

August 29Cody Kennedy
Yeah dude
So any other plans to screen in la?

August 29Eugene Kotlyarenko
umm maybe at ucla...and other than that, just wanna what and see what my new sales agents are up to

August 29Cody Kennedy
Yeah that would be nice, the hammer and the bruin theatre both have pretty good programming

August 29Eugene Kotlyarenko
i feel like melnitz is what im thinking
which is where i usually go

August 29Cody Kennedy
Oh I'm not familiar

August 29Eugene Kotlyarenko
its like the student theater, showing independent films generally

August 29Cody Kennedy
Cool, yeah I just looked at some of their stuff but do they only have a mailing list?
Can't find a calendar

August 29Eugene Kotlyarenko
hmmm
yeah dont know if there is a calendar
just get the emails pretty much

August 30Cody Kennedy
hey
oh yeah so i forgot to ask you

August 30Eugene Kotlyarenko
yo
k...

August 30Cody Kennedy
if you've seen a movie called thomas in love
so have you seen a movie called thomas in love

August 30Eugene Kotlyarenko
hmm no
what is that?

August 30Cody Kennedy
oh wow haha

August 30Eugene Kotlyarenko
is it old? foreign?

August 30Cody Kennedy
skydiver was so similar
yeah it's french

August 30Eugene Kotlyarenko
skydiver was?!?!

August 30Cody Kennedy
yeah!

August 30Eugene Kotlyarenko
whoa weird

August 30Cody Kennedy
ok so the whole movie takes place on webcam

August 30Eugene Kotlyarenko
meaning its like webcams?

August 30Cody Kennedy
yeah

August 30Eugene Kotlyarenko
whoa crazy
so its new

August 30Cody Kennedy
2000

August 30Eugene Kotlyarenko
does it predate skydiver?
whoa
damn i should download it

August 30Cody Kennedy
yeah you have to see it

August 30Eugene Kotlyarenko
is it good?

August 30Cody Kennedy
it's on netflix

August 30Eugene Kotlyarenko
im getting rid of my netflix account
is it a good movie?

August 30Cody Kennedy
aw shit
well it's very interesting
he creates a world where 'online dating' is normal but 'online sex' is totally taboo

August 30Eugene Kotlyarenko
who is he?

August 30Cody Kennedy
and the main character is scared of going outside

August 30Eugene Kotlyarenko
hmm
yeah thats like def one of the challenges for those sorts of movie
i mean a webcam concept
the main character has to be glued to his computer
originally i was thinking of being a corrupt business man in house arrest

August 30Cody Kennedy
oh yeah and the main concept is that if he goes outside he'll die
like his heart will explode from extreme fear
but he's super rich ya

August 30Eugene Kotlyarenko
wait what? in that moive?
or an extrapolation of my business man idea?

August 30Cody Kennedy
no in that movie
that's the concept of the movie

August 30Eugene Kotlyarenko
oh ok cool
yeah ill download it - cool
let u know what i think

August 30Cody Kennedy
yeah and there were some other crazy parallels but i can't think of them
like the last shot is the only shot away from the computer
and it's left up to you to decide if he's committed suicide
and the internet porn thing
but yeah definitely watch it, probably the first 'webcam movie'
thomas in love

August 30Eugene Kotlyarenko
cool -- i assume it has its own interface not like skype/ichat

August 30Cody Kennedy
yeah everytime someone's on webcam there's weird visuals behind them
or sometimes it's an apartment or whatever but it all has this very outside reality thing
oh yeah and the first scene is like a 3d animated porn

August 30Eugene Kotlyarenko
gotchya, i will check it

September 12Cody Kennedy
Yo!! http://cinema.usc.edu/events/event.cfm?id=12069 he didn't even tell me but I just saw this, did he contact you?

September 12Eugene Kotlyarenko
hey cody! yeah i found out yesterday. my producer has been communicating with the guy who is organizing it! I'm sure your mentioning it didn't hurt either! I am pretty psyched! should be fun. I hope to see you there!

September 12Cody Kennedy
i will definitely be there man

October 5Cody Kennedy
hey wanna hear an idea for a movie
just thought of it
it's very 'kotlyarkenonian'

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
sing it sister

October 5Cody Kennedy
ok so i've always been annoyed at the catch 22 of hipsterdom and it's kind of hard to explain why
but i think i got it in this movie
have a future world where eugenics come back into style
and then make a movie about a guy without hands
who has to ride a bike for a living

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
wait why would he have to ride a bike for a living?

October 5Cody Kennedy
courier

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
but why would he do that if he had no hands...

October 5Cody Kennedy
it's absurdism
like this is supposed to be a ridiculous movie

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
i see...but couldn't he get a diff job?

October 5Cody Kennedy
it's the only job

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
hahha

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
in the world?

October 5Cody Kennedy
like the only job he can find because it's very difficult
hard times in the future dawg

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
ok
go on

October 5Cody Kennedy
anyway he hears that this job is open and builds a contraption to like be able to hold onto the handles
but he can't pull the brakes so he's forced to ride a fixie
and then his bike gets stolen
and then he just keeps going through life
oh right so i forgot to mention one of the qualities people look for in the future in order to euthanize is 'being a total hipster'

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
my concept for hipster critique is a slasher film

October 5Cody Kennedy
otherwise you're sent off to surely die in a really intense far off war

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
i am almost on the verge of writing it

October 5Cody Kennedy
oh nice
wait so let me finish

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
go on

October 5Cody Kennedy
the filmmakers are then accused by the police for being total hipsters
and interrupt the shooting of one scene
because the film is obviously bicycle thief inspired

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
so its a mockumentary..?

October 5Cody Kennedy
well then it turns into a metanarrative about the filmmakers
and then like, the metanarrative gets attacked for being hipster

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
idk
have you ever seen Punishment Park

October 5Cody Kennedy
and then the last scene is this camera being confiscated and then there's a totally unrelated movie tacked on at the end
and it's a macho sports movie with like a super happy ending
okay thats it
and no
good?

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
well it should be like some government propoganda film,, rather than a sports movie, unless it had some government sanctioned subtext

October 5Cody Kennedy
yes mockumentary at the end haha
ooo that would make sense
but the idea would be that it's government propaganda anyway

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
right but just has to be sorta obvious

October 5Cody Kennedy
it's just like a government engineered sports film
hmm yeah i've been watching a lot of todd haynes and theres this one movie called poison that's three totally different movies entertwined
and i just liked the idea of it being a totally unrelated movie
but it could be like a really intense war film that demonizes terrorists or something

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
yeah those movies shares disgusting thematic connections

October 5Cody Kennedy
to be more obvious
haha how so
and whats your slasher film

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
umm they are all about like the horrors of alienation i would say
just about this slasher who kills a bunch of cool kids at a party
it would just be my way to make observations about youth culture
its not very developed; i am writing two other movies ahead of it

October 5Cody Kennedy
oh i like it
i wanted to make a slasher film about hippies
but make it more about the fact that the killer is this guy's brother and everyone kinda knows he kills people
in the family

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
my friend is writing a novel about murder and burnt out hippies
he is a really great writer
he might writ this slasher film too down the line

October 5Cody Kennedy
oh siq whats his name
oh yeah but i kind of got the idea of the whole hipsters being euthanized from this real thing that was happening in japan where politicians accused the country of 'overlearning'
and people that liked math and science were suspect basically
yeah i've been watching slasher films too
getting into john carpenter
writing about him in this paper

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
yeah john carpenter is great

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
the song from assault on precinct 13 is one of the best songs

October 5Cody Kennedy
yeah the story of how the thing was made is really interesting
like basically E.T. rained on his parade

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
they seem oike apples and oranges

October 5Cody Kennedy
they are!
they're the exact opposite movie
which is crazy

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
you should invite people to the screenning if you know anyone who would dig it

October 5Cody Kennedy
universal put way more effort into promoting ET and the thing never even broke even
and et was like the highest selling movie in history at the time
yeah dude i made a few facebook posts
i'll talk to a few more people like day before
week before

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
no worries, sounds good
you can repost the event page or invite people if you want

October 5Cody Kennedy
ya ya i saw the event page
dude i thought it had screened in la before
like once at the sunset 5
was i wrong to think that

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
yes
u were wrong

October 5Cody Kennedy
weird i wonder why i thought that
crazy that it's an la movie too

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
idk
ya

October 5Cody Kennedy
oo looks like ya boy morgan is getting some work
lena dunham tv movie sounds awesome

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
its a tv series i thin
yeah im looing forward to i

October 5Cody Kennedy
cool ya it says movie on imdb but those things change
it's funny how apatow is farming indie people now
the girl from breaking upwards was in the other guys
oh fuk nvm mixing him up with adam mckay
whatevs

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
idk
i hope everyone who is working hard and making interesitng things succeeds beyond their wildest dreams

October 5Cody Kennedy
ya its rough
my friend released a youth lagoon single before they got picked up by fat possum
i was talking to him the day they got bnm about how he felt about it and it was pretty obvious he was depressed
playing tetris
i've never had one of my friends become super successful idk
except joseph sorta
but that was pretty obvious he'd become a great critic

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
success is tricky
and relative

October 5Cody Kennedy
troof
i thought being called 'this generation's ulysses' by even like one person was success haha
but it's probably not as cool as it sounds
more like contradictory

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
it sounds great
but doesnt mean anything if no one will ever see it

October 5Cody Kennedy
yeah it's so fucking weird
i seriously don't understand it
you made a huge splash in new york

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
well you havent seen the movie
so maybe if you see it you will realize why people dont like it
its not a perfect movie
and its certainly not for everyone

October 5Cody Kennedy
oh well yeah but i don't understand how you could have something that widely read and talked about and then get almost nothing in return
and then i realized that people don't really read newspapers any more

October 5Cody Kennedy
just as a more overall concept

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
well the world of film exhibition/distribution is very strange
and very cutthroat - like all of hollywood

October 5Cody Kennedy
yeah how the fuck did winters bone get so much hype
when it's so widely hated by college students
really weird
and even though i didn't find it offensively bad, people hated the shit out of slumdog millionaire
it's like no one takes 20-somethings seriously because we have the internet

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
idk
i thought scott pilgrim was a great moie
but it flopped in theaters
but it has 2.5 million facebook fans

October 5Cody Kennedy
exactly

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
so theres a lot of inconsistency
like 2.5 million facebook fans should be at least like 60mill worldwide if you extrapolate
but it only made like 20
so who knows
plus it was a very good movie

October 5Cody Kennedy
the thing was a huge flop and now it's getting a prequel

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
obviously cool young people - while influential, dont have much capital expenditure and so market influence ESPECIALLY with regard to movies --- unless they are teenagers

October 5Cody Kennedy
it blows man
and we're all in that weird guilt stage of not wanting to starve to death but also wanting to watch movies

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
its true, its too expensive to go to movies
its like if the movie is less than amazing i will hate paying 13 dollars for it
like i saw drive

October 5Cody Kennedy
ugh

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
and thought it was terrible

October 5Cody Kennedy
tell me about it

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
when it was merely mediocre

October 5Cody Kennedy
a hot girl dragged me to step up 2 the streets
and we didn't even hook up
it's that kind of shit
where people literally only go to the movies if they're with friends
and they're friends are all fuckin retarded
*their and retarded is probably not the most acceptable word
whens the last time you went to cinefamily

October 5Eugene Kotlyarenko
long time

by eating lots of steak
yeah i went for some george kuchar screenings but i need to go more often
thought i might see you there

October 17Cody Kennedy
hey so i watched 'the adventures of mary kate and ashley: the case of the mystery cruise' yesterday

October 17Eugene Kotlyarenko
k.

October 17Cody Kennedy
just because it was morgan's first film appearance
and it was also a movie about a missing computer!

October 17Eugene Kotlyarenko
amazing!
did they find it?

October 17Cody Kennedy
just wondering if you guys ever talked about that

October 17Eugene Kotlyarenko
hahahaha i dont think so

October 17Cody Kennedy
yeah it was the mime!

October 17Eugene Kotlyarenko
ive def never seen it, i wonder if morgan has even seen it
how very antonioni

October 17Cody Kennedy
haha
no but that was crazy i was just kind of half heartedly flipping through and then they're talking about this missing computer
and the dad spent 5 years working on a communicator to control the minds of marine mammals
it was actually a really weird concept to me

October 17Eugene Kotlyarenko
hahaha
the stakes are soo high

October 17Cody Kennedy
I KNOW

October 17Eugene Kotlyarenko
yeah damn if that gets into the wrong hands....

October 17Eugene Kotlyarenko
dolphins controlled by terrorists, etc.

October 17Cody Kennedy
i know and the mimes are super sketchy and there's scenes of them at craps tables
and i'm like how can you place a bid if you can't talk
i gotta go but had to share
but yeah joseph is visiting nov 4-6
so keep that in mind haha
later

October 17Eugene Kotlyarenko
k
