hi dude i made you a twitter
the only reason i made it was to mention you on my other twitter http://twitter.com/vivagoodvibes
but i hope it is a good 'placeholder twitter' that 'looks like you made it' 
if you are soooo not down for twitter
i understand but keep it up so that my twitter has continuity!
#whitegirltwitterproblems
it can just have a few things like 'hi this is the twitter for holypage!'
and then thats it if thats how you want to keep it
or if you want i could just manage your twittering
i would make it cool and seem like christian filardo has more time on his hands than he actually does
and try to get celebs to follow back rt and etc
also the goodvibes twitter and the holypage twitter are on the same gmail!

November 3Cody Kennedy
so to log in to both would be easy
i give you my gmail address and the password we can trade goodvibes and holypage updates
i leave it up to you #goodvibes

November 6Cody Kennedy
hey
did you get my messages?

November 6Christian Michael Filardo
Yeah! I meant to respond

November 6Cody Kennedy
cool man what do you think

November 6Christian Michael Filardo
I am not much of a twitter guy, it is nor user friendly for me and my phone situation. Is there a way to dixie chain update it from my facebook stream?!

November 6Cody Kennedy
yah!
lots of ways
in fact a lot of thing (hootsuite being the best) push updates all over the fookkin place
i could help you out with that some day that i'm not scrambling to finish a paper
but yeah the password is buttmunch
so tweet wit ya bad self
don't get too many on the following side it makes you look lame and desperate
with twitter you are judged by your numbers
following being how many people you follow
and followers being how many people follow you
you are following five right now but if you get over like 1000 on following you look like a douchebag
and it's always better to have more followers than following!!!
TWITTER BASICS

November 6Christian Michael Filardo

November 6Cody Kennedy

but understand i really want to make goodvibes a microblog of the future!
