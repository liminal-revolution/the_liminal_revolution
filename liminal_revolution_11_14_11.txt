build a following

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
What of like within a few days
All the followers are like NO WEBSITE
Fuck this is BORING
UNFOLLOW
And I'm like NOOO JUST GIVE ME A FEW DAYS

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
lolololo

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
Oh I have lots of ideas
Fuck

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
ooo do tell!

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
Like tons

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
omg
have you compliled lists?

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
But it will initially be like

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
or is it just like
in the head

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
A splash page and a blog.
Subdomain
And the splash page would just be an immaculate version of the twitter feed

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
ooo
dude!
if you need any help!!
id be glad to!

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
But probs just have like the tumblr hosted there direct until I figure it out
And yeah I've been thinking about giving you the pword
....
I need to be able to trust you though.....

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
oh yeah definitely
i have no reason to meddle
or mess anything up

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
It's important that it all seems like its coming from a singular voice

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
and im EDDY
oh yeah i remember you saying that
i mean you wouldnt have to worry about me like

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
Yeah but not like 'fuck it up' but match the tone

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
messing that up
im way too distracted to probably log into the account and post anyway

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
I mean...

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
but if there's anything more designerly you need me to do
i can definitely do that!

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
Eh

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
not too much?
ahahah
thats definitely cool tho

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
Yeah obviously I would love your help
But the most important part to me is like
Having it CONSTANT
Like the way people become twitter famous is by doing it all the fucking time

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
ahh
yeah that makes sense

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
I've been trying but I need to specifically have like
Quality
I mean I told a story through trance for trance war last night
I couldn't do that from my phone

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
ahh

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
Yeah...
But it's also very important that I cover my tracks
Like I speak in first person
But the idea is that it's like this altered and shared persona

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
ahh

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
Design is important but I need writers

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
that makes sesne
well i'd definitely need more time to absorb the writing

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
Yeh

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
i'm rusty when it comes to really thoughtful writing
so i should prolly hold off before im allowed to edit

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
Definitely read it often....

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
yup!
dang

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
It's not that hard to understand

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
it'd be helpful to find someone trustworthy on the other side of the world

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
Like pure positivity
Yeah fuck
I sent a call for writers but no responses

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
ahhh

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
Hop hop

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
what about like joseph in NY?

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
*hoo hoo

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
is he trustworthy to be a writer?

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
Well...
Yeah but like
He's not holding out his hand so to speak
He definitely liked the idea
But I don't know if he's ready for that sort of purely positive thing
He's like one of the most cynical people I know

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
oh
ahahaha

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
I mean he's a definite candidate

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
that makes sense though

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
Ugh I wish I wasn't so picky
Well actually it's not that picky

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
no it's not
i agree with you
if you want it to be super super solid
you need like one voice

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
so you should be picky with people

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
La is full of goons that have buddha statues and make crazy vj things
Like

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
i mean even i don't want to write for it jsut yet

18 hours agoCody Kennedy

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades

18 hours agoCody Kennedy

Throw some parties

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
It's a pretty Cali notion...

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades

Hang loose

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades

18 hours agoCody Kennedy

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
Fuck

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
oh god
ahahaha

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
That took forever

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
well i'll get to work on dat shit right away!!!
i mean i've been thinking about it
but it seems so sick
like it's a really brandable vision

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
??

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
i don't want to put it like this per se
but it's SO HIP
can be SO HIP
if done really well

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
Duh

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
but yeah!

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
Thats the fucking point
Hahaha

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
Branding positivity

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
i have lots of time to fuck around

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
O sure
Haha
Ok so to start
vGv in the Calvin Klein logo font

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
ooo

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
The two vs very slightly incringing on the g
And split into vertical bands
That's the logo
I haven't designed it yet
But if you drew up a version id love to talk about color choices
That's been like fist order of business
Pink and blue are pretty good
But maybe vibrancy is better
Green would be nice

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
ooo
yeah it's funny i thought that pink would work really well with the whole vibe too
when i started thinking about it awhile ago

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
Yeah I love pink

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
i'll definitely draw some things up for you though

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
Pink and green?

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
what kinda green?

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
Like super bright green?

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
like on the lighter side right
yess

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
Lol
And then like gradients

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades
were you thinking like subtle ones or relaly contrasy

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
Each bar is a different value

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades

18 hours agoCody Kennedy
Subtle i guess
Like professional

18 hours agoEdouard Urcades

18 hours agoCody Kennedy

Waiting for my fucking payroll

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
but the goodvibes continue on.////

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
God dammit
I know

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
even in the worst situations...

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
Dude it's so weird ever since I got my laptop and phone I've had to readjust
And it's like oh wow this is the life I used to live and its really boring

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
oh god ahah
awesome

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
Like having the technology makes me automatically distracted

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
hahah

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
And therefore I can't enjoy life
It's such a conundrum
I'm glad something physical came out of it is the twitter

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
hohoho

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
To be honest that twitter is just a reminder of what it was like

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
There are these incredible experiences that happen and nothing physical or productive comes out

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
oo
yeah

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
Ie acid trips or like going to shows
I guess I want to remember all these things

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
ahh

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
And since the new hot shit is social networking thats my medium

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
i see isee

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
I mean that and just fits really well into the idea
Being broke and without the means to do schoolwork was fucking awesome
Except right now
Because I just passed the slice truck

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
ahh
oh god

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
And now I have images of beautiful beautiful pizza
God dammit
I paid for the fucking email service on godaddy which is such a fucking horrible joke
30 dollars.
Could have spent it on pizza

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
oh my god why did you do that IFJGNIDFJGISDJbg

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
God. Dammit.

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
its godaddy for gods sakeee

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
Because i wanted to have #goodvibes@goodvi.biz
Im sure there's a cheaper way but I'm hoping that money won't be as much of an issue if i get some traffic going

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
ooo
wow
yeah yeah

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
I mean paying for godaddy
Fuck dude
Two weeks of being unplugged is crazy
I need to find ways of doing it more often
Like obviously not totally unplugged
But forcing myself to go to libraries and like not having anything on my person

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
ooo
yeah it's really freeing

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
Except that shitty phone

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
i get to do that a lot more often
it's so nice

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
Ooo
Why

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
well i'm doing a lot of running around between like
studio, shop, digital lab, digital culture building
and i just carry pen and paper with me
it's really freeing

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
Ohhh

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
and it feels like im actually doing something
'designing'

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
But I mean like

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
instead of sitting arounf

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
Total isolation

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
ahh
icic

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
From your laptop
Like basically outing your laptop in a safe

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
ahhh

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
Ya 
Oh yeah and like
Getting peoples numbers constantly
Because you don't have them
I just saw my old classmate walking while reading a book

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
Baha nerdy vibes
Celebrate nerds

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
yess

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
Fuck it's so awkward doing it on this phone it's like I'm a different person

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
HAHA
doing what??
updating the twitter?

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
It's like the whole celebrate the good vibes thing is just old now

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
ooh

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
I mean I knew this would happen and I would have to push through
But...
'that feeling'

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
oo

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
Sometimes when I'm sitting alone
In darkened corridors
Or at the edge of my bed
I rock back and forth and ask myself
The same burning question
The same... Fucking... Question
WHAT'S A GOON TO A GOBLIN?

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
LIKIOOOLOL
watt
WAT

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
I want to know what is a goon to a goblin
And I can't find an answer

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
oh
i see. . . .

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
I can't find... COFF COFF... The answer
No matter how hard I read the thousands of pages
The question remains

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
LOLOLOL

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
I spent my whole life wondering
And the single encounter I had with a goblin
He told me ......
He told me to go away ..... (;v_;v)
The criteria compared to your career.... IT ISN'T FAIR

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
LOLOLLOLO

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
Goblin you have no right to dismiss me. You ain't scarin naawtin
God it would be hilarious to have a totally straight faced movie
Like Daniel day lewis shit
And just have characters searching for answers to questions in rap songs

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
lollloolol
LOLLOLO
omg

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
But they don't like
Know that they're from rap songs
There's just like no end to lines of dialogue referencing raps
And they're totally serious

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
LOLOLOL

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
And to people who don't listen to rap it's like this beautifully tragic movie

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
like an ancient manuscript
written in rap lyrics
oh my god dude
aliens are gonna find these

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
But they have to listen to like the cackling of teenagers through tears

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
and weep
LOL

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
WHY ARE THEY LAUGHING
God just like galaxy quest
Hahaha

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
Such a good fucking movie
I love that movie

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
LOOLOL

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
I remember watching it as a kid and not being sure to laugh or to cry when the guy was like 'those poor poor people' in reference to Gillian's island

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
omg

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
It was legitimately sad to me
To imagine someone thinking it was real

Perception is a bitch
4 real

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
lolool

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
I'm not even kidding like

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
yeah though
its really trure

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
I was In a theatre twice weeping as other people were laughing
Once in piña and once in some Luther price screenings
Sans tilde

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
omg
why?

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
Like to me it was so fucking sad
This one scene
Like unreal
I couldn't even explain if I tried
But pina is cinema art
I had such a good cry
See it in 3d
Like I say pina is cinema art without pretension
Walking out it was almost like everything from Bergman to matthew Barney was just bullshit
Like totally cathartic
Rocked my fucking world

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
whoa\
thats crazy

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
I mean it's not even like
Imaginable in the context of cinema

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
hm

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
It has cinematic elements but as far as just seeing moving images
It was like
Holy fucking Christ
It should be played in fucking cathedrals

17 hours agoEdouard Urcades
wow
that's a rather big description
:OOo

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
Like yeah
It's a big movie

17 hours agoCody Kennedy
It's a
Movie about eyes

16 hours agoCody Kennedy
Oh man
Salty delicious chikin and herb
Fuck
Garlic chicken essentially
Fuck that was awesome
A little too much salt
And oil
I don't eat chicken because I think it's fine dining
I eat it because I'm not afraid to pack salt on it
Like steak is a different beast entirely
Chickens like an allspice
However it would be pretty cool to have steak from time to time
