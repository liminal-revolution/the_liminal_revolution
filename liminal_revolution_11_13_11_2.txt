NM JST SCROBBLIN

wow
i hope one day
i can scrobble

IRL SCROBBLE
like just list all the songs you're listening to
on paper
or make paintings for each song

:LOLOLOL

you only listen to music when you're painting
and the painting process only lasts as long as you scrobble
but if you listen on repeat

thats a pretty good concept

you can perfect the painting

write it down or else i am

and the scrobbles increase
LOL

or we both can write it down

WE CAN BOTH SCROBBLE THE IDEA
dude but
but
but
it's already

omg

WRITTEN DOWN

so tru

so tru
ok burritoo time
be are be
