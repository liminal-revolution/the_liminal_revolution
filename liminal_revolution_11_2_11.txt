do you want to know the coolest thing
you're going to flip out
i promise
when i was in high school i drew a symbol all over my notebooks
in my textbooks
everything
i thought to myself 'if i ever get a tattoo this is what it will be'
my heart is literally racing right now

November 2Cody Kennedy
it was a double helix snake that looked EXACTLY LIKE THAT

November 2Ania Urbańska

November 2Cody Kennedy

not even high school earlier
the pit of my stomach is full of anxiety this is incredible

i can't even express to you how much that means to me
and the fact that you were talking about spiritual journeys
'here it comes' and then i see it and have instant nostalgia
i  the eye and the rocks too

November 2Ania Urbańska
crystal mountains
and an air symbol
that was the original
now i added the serpent
looks like a 3 eyed smiley face haha

November 2Cody Kennedy
sight earth air and serpent
absolutely beautiful A+++ great tattooist

November 2Ania Urbańska
serpent is earth
lol

November 2Cody Kennedy

crystals are still earth though

November 2Ania Urbańska
